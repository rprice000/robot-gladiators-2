## Description
JavaScript—along with HTML and CSS—is one of the three foundational technologies of web development. While HTML and CSS define the structure, content, and layout of a webpage, JavaScript makes webpages fully interactive. To put it simply, JavaScript lets us "do things" in a web browser, such as watch a video by clicking a play button or comment on a friend's photo on social media.  In this module, we'll use JavaScript to build a browser-based video game that we'll enter in a fictional hackathon called the Con Solo Game Jam, which has the following rules:
- The game must be created by a single developer in 24 hours.
- The game must run in a web browser.
- The game must use the provided index.html file.
- Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed.
- Participants cannot use CSS.
- All game code must be contained in the game.js JavaScript file.
- Extra points will be given for high-quality code

We will learn how to do the following:

- Communicate with the game player by using JavaScript functions.
- Assign and manipulate data using JavaScript variables and operators.
- Control the flow of the application by managing conditional statements.

The Game will work as follows:
- The game will prompt the player to name their robot.
- The player's robot will be initialized with the following properties:
-- 100 health points
-- 10 attack points
-- 10 money points
- The player's opponent, Roborto, will be initialized with the following properties:
-- 50 health points
-- 12 attack points
- The game will display "Welcome to Robot Gladiators!"
- The game will prompt the player to either fight the round or skip it.
- If the player chooses to skip:
-- A penalty of 10 money points will be deducted from the player's robot.
-- The game will end.
- If the player chooses to fight:
- The player's robot will attack Roborto, and the player-robot's attack points will be deducted from Roborto's health points.
- The game will display Roborto's remaining health points.
- Roborto will attack the player's robot, and Roberto's attack points will be deducted from the player's robot's health points.
- The game will display the player-robot's remaining health points.
- The game will end.
